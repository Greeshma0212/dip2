Project Overview
This project implements a Weighted Voronoi Image Stippling System using MATLAB. The goal is to generate stippled images by distributing points based on image brightness and visualizing Voronoi diagrams for geometric representation. The system includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use, allowing users to load datasets, define stippling parameters, and view results interactively. The stippling process utilizes pixel brightness for weighted point generation and Voronoi diagram construction.

Features
Dataset Loader: Load a folder containing multiple images for processing.
Customizable Stippling Points: Define the number of points for stippling dynamically.
Image Navigation: View processed images with "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
Voronoi Diagram Visualization: Displays geometric cell boundaries over the stippled image.
Status Updates: Provides real-time feedback during image processing.
Output Saving: Saves processed images with stippling and Voronoi overlays into a designated folder.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of high-resolution flower images.

Source: Custom dataset or publicly available image datasets.
Dataset Size: User-defined based on the folder contents.
Contents: .jpg or .png images with rich textures and varied brightness for testing.
Requirements
MATLAB: Version R2021b or higher.
Toolboxes: Image Processing Toolbox.
Operating System: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
